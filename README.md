Geek Bowl Score Keeper

This is a simple web-based score keeper for quiz-bowl style contests. It uses AngularJS and Bootstrap to draw team names, scores, and a countdown timer and is only expected to run in the Chrome web browser.

The following features are available:

1. Click on a team name to provide a new name to be displayed.
2. Press '1' to increment the score of team one.
3. Press '!' (Shift + 1) to decrement the score of team one.
4. Press '2' to increment the score of team two.
5. Press '@' (Shift + 2) to decrement the score of team two.
6. Press '0' to start a 10-second timer that plays a buzzer at the end.
7. Press '5' to start a 5-second timer that plays a buzzer at the end.
8. Press '-' to clear the current timer and prevent the buzzer from being played.
